title: Probabilistic Computing Project
post-preview: We build probabilistic computing systems that exploit uncertain knowledge to learn from data, infer its probable causes, make calibrated predictions and choose effective actions. We also study the computational principles and building blocks needed to design, implement and analyze these systems, drawing on and contributing to an emerging integration of key ideas from probability theory and computer science. Our research includes work on machine learning and artificial intelligence fundamentals, as well as applications to modeling human cognition and to intelligent data analysis.

**[Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu)** is a project I'm currently enrolled in at MIT.

BayesDB is a Bayesian database that lets users query the probable implications of their data as easily as a SQL database lets them query the data itself. Using the built-in Bayesian Query Language (BQL), users with no statistics training can solve basic data science problems, such as detecting predictive relationships between variables, inferring missing values, simulating probable observations, and identifying statistically similar database entries.

BayesDB is suitable for analyzing complex, heterogeneous data tables with up to tens of thousands of rows and hundreds of variables. No preprocessing or parameter adjustment is required, though experts can override BayesDB’s default assumptions when appropriate.

BayesDB’s inferences are based in part on CrossCat, a new, nonparametric Bayesian machine learning method, that automatically estimates the full joint distribution behind arbitrary data tables.
