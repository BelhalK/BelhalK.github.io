**[Adalid - Trends in Jewelry Market using Deep Learning](http://belhalk.github.io/2016/04/01/Adalid-Trends-in-Jewelry-Market-using-Deep-Learning.html)** is a project I realized with two friends working in the industry in NYC at that time

ADALID started with three friends with complementary skills and wanting to disrupt an old fashionned industry. The Jewelery market was waiting for its real tech disruption and we thought about using cutting edge technology to value huge amount of online content for the sake of this industry.


For instance, here is an example of colours, size and type of jewels we were able to detect on thousand of instagram photos we scrapped in order to detect trends in jewels shape and colours:

Another use case consists in analyzing in real time the performance of your products. Using both deep learning to detect the product and NLP to do sentiment analysis.
