**[Gates Foundation - Data Science](http://www.gatesfoundation.org)** is a project I started within the ProbBomp Lab.

The project consisted in applying Bayesian Statistics to enable domain experts that lack statistical expertise to perform qualitative model checking and encode simple forms of qualitative prior knowledge.
Focus on Data Visualisation and building strong reliable statistical models based on bayesian inference strategies and dependency blocks on Growth & Development datasets (Malnutrition, IQ, Health..) in developing countries.
