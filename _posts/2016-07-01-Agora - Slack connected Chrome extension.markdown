title: Agora - Slack Connected Chrome Extension
post-preview: Agora is the solution to better manage knowledge on Slack channels within any company. Most of the time, slack users send each other website url to check out and start off an endless discussion automatically distracting the other members from other important informations on the same channel. Our solution aims at migrating those discussion to the website of interest and more specifically create a discussion on the website itself through our Chrome extension.

**[Agora - Slack Connected Chrome Extension](http://www.getagora.io/)** is a project I started with three classmates and kept on developping over the summer.

We started this project with the willingness to make the internet browsing a funnier experience. Most of the time, internet users wanting to share the latest website they've been visiting, copy paste that url and send it through their favorit messaging app. A real UX headache.
We thought about using the opportunity that the everyday brower gave us.We started developping an extension that would display a comment section on every website at the right end of the window.
While this solution was originally made for all internet users, the issue of quantifying knowledge and managing noise on Slack channels represented a first usecase for our extension.
