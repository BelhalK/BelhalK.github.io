## About
I'm a Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the Institution of Technology and Innovation in Paris, and currently visiting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I spend most of my time at the [Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). Before that I was at Supelec in France where I received my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (MS) in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and a Master's degree in Economics and Innovation at Telecom ParisTech.

I've been using data science and machine learning techniques in various domains such as :
<p align="left"><b>Social Sciences:</b> Telecom ParisTech - Behaviors toward private data disclosure<br>
<b>Economics:</b> Agoranov - Job creation by startups<br>
<b>Education:</b> MIT - US College Scorecard<br>
<b>Growth &amp; Development:</b> Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation - HBGDki</p>

At the moment, I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and Computational Social Science. I would like to solve the Social Interaction mystery using Data Science and Computer Science.
