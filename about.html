## About
I'm a Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the Institution of Technology and Innovation in Paris, and currently visiting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I spend most of my time at the [Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/). Before that I was at Supelec in France where I received my Diplôme d'Ingénieur (MS) in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and a Master's degree in Economics and Innovation at Telecom ParisTech.

I'm passionate about new technologies and always eager to learn. At the moment, I am mainly interested in Machine Learning and Computational Social Science. I would like to solve the Social Interaction mystery using Data Science and Computer Science.
I've been using data science and machine learning techniques in various domains such as :

- Social Sciences (Telecom ParisTech - Behaviors toward private data disclosure)
- Economics (Agoranov - Job creation by startups)
- Education (MIT - US College Scorecard)
- Growth & Development (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation - HBGDki)
